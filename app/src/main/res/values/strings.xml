        Visualization of Infant Vocalizations for Hearing Impaired Parents
        \n\n
        Dr. Ariana Anderson from Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) is conducting a research study.
        You were selected as a possible participant in this study because you are responsible for a child. Your participation in this research study is voluntary.
        \n\n
        • Why is this study being done?
        The purpose of the study is to create a baby monitor smart-phone app for hearing impaired parents, which will allow infant vocalizations to be transmitted and “translated” into both a visualization modality and labeled states on the smart-phone of hearing impaired parents. The study may help us understand how infant vocalizations change over time and with different needs, and how to visually “translate” this information so that a hearing-impaired parent may interpret a child’s vocal cues.
        The secondary purpose of this study is to collect infant vocalizations to identify vocal patterns associated with autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Your uploaded audio samples will be stored in a secure HIPAA compliant server along with your Infant History Questionnaire. You may also be given a followup survey(s) whenyour baby is older regarding whether your infant has been diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental disorder.
        \n\n
        • What will happen if I take part in this research study?
        If you volunteer to participate in this study, the researcher will ask you to do the following:
        \n
        \n • Take audio recordings of your child
        \n • Record your perception of your child's mood state
        \n • Fill out questionnaires regarding your infant's developmental history and family background.
        \n\n
        \n • Whatever decision you make, there will be no penalty to you, and no loss of benefits to which you were otherwise entitled.
        \n • You may refuse to answer any questions that you do not want to answer and still remain in the study.
        \n\n
        • How long will I be in the research study?
        Participation will take a total of about 30 minutes. You may record your child’s vocalizations in smaller time periods, and on your own time.
        • Are there any potential risks or discomforts that I can expect from this study?
        All research contains some risks. While there is no physical danger from this study, there is always the potential for a breach in confidentiality. We have sought to minimize this risk as much as possible. The study and accompanying Chatter Baby software are specifically designed to protect your privacy, using the same HIPAA compliant security features that are used to store medical data. Although we have thoroughly tested the software, it is, however, possible that a yet unseen bug in the code might accidentally lead to identification.
        •  Are there any potential benefits if I participate?
        There are no direct benefits to you or your child for participating in this research study.
        • What are my rights if I take part in this study?
        \n • You can choose whether or not you want to be in this study, and you may withdraw your consent and discontinue participation at any time.
        \n • Whatever decision you make, there will be no penalty to you, and no loss of benefits to which you were otherwise entitled.
        \n • You may refuse to answer any questions that you do not want to answer and still remain in the study.
        » Who can I contact if I have questions about this study?
        \n\n • The research team:
        If you have any questions, comments or concerns about the research, you can talk to the one of the researchers. Please contact:
