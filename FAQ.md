## CHATTERBABY FAQs
 
### 1)    What is ChatterBaby?
ChatterBaby is an app that helps you determine whether and why your baby is crying, by translating your baby’s cry into a need. It works by analyzing the specific sounds that your baby makes when he or she is crying and comparing them with nearly 2000 other sounds in our “baby cry” database. In other words, it uses math(emagics) to translate your baby’s cry into a need, such as fussy, hungry, or pain.
Please note that once you begin using the app to quickly and easily solve the “why won’t the baby stop crying” dilemma, perhaps even gaining the reputation of ‘baby whisperer,’ we strongly suggest that you reach out and apologize to any math teacher in your life who has ever been asked “Why do I even need to learn this?!”


### 2)    How accurate is ChatterBaby?
ChatterBaby correctly captures and predicts “crying” (vs babbling or laughing) approximately 90% of the time. Furthermore, it can translate with over 90% accuracy whether a new baby cry is due to pain compared to fussy and hungry states.  When using the algorithm to analyze a sound clip, you should use data with minimal background noise.  If you feed ChatterBaby a sound clip of you singing to your crying infant it will not work. If you feed ChatterBaby a sound clip of your dog barking, it will not work. 



### 3)    How can I make ChatterBaby work better on my baby?
The ChatterBaby algorithm can actually be personalized specifically for your baby! By sending us audio or video clips of your baby crying along with a description of why (e.g. he’s hungry vs. he just got his vaccines vs. his big brother scared him by wearing a clown mask), we can “teach” the algorithm the unique nuances of your baby’s cry and optimize its predictive accuracy.  

If you’re interested in a personalized ChatterBaby for your infant, please send your labeled audio or video samples to <arianaanderson@mednet.ucla.edu>, with a brief description of why you think your baby is crying, as well as your infant’s age (in months) and gender. Remember, the more audio data you provide, the more fine-tuning we can do!

After we generate your personalized ChatterBaby, we ask that you donate your labeled audio samples for use in our growing database. Please be assured that we take your privacy very seriously – all samples are scrubbed of any identifying information and rendered completely anonymous.


### 4)    What kinds of cries does ChatterBaby predict?
The algorithm differentiates between three common reasons for crying in babies: Hunger, Fussiness, and Pain.  If your baby is crying because he really, really, wants to eat some Legos and you just won’t let him (true story), it will not work. We are adding other states such as colic, gassy, dirty diaper, scared, and bored, once we have enough evidence to show these states are reliable.  Sad fact: separation anxiety cries are predicted as “pain” by our algorithm.   
 

### 5)    The ChatterBaby algorithm said my baby isn’t in pain. Does that mean she’s healthy?
NO! ChatterBaby can only tell you if your baby is crying because she’s in acute pain – it cannot provide any insight into whether your baby is healthy or sick, whether it’s an emergency or not, whether you should call your doctor even though its 3am. Our algorithm never made it into med school, but your doctor thankfully did! So if you think your baby is sick, always call your doctor (yes, even at 3am)! ChatterBaby is not meant to be used as a substitute for appropriate medical care.
 

### 6)    Can I trust the ChatterBaby algorithm?
You can trust ChatterBaby to translate ~ 90% of the time whether your baby’s reason for crying is because she is experiencing some degree of pain. However, your parental instincts and intuition are far more powerful than our fanciest equations. If the ChatterBaby translation and your common sense disagree, always trust your own judgment.
 

### 7)    What happens to my data?
We store it for science on a server that is HIPAA-compliant; the data is “de-identified,” which means that we remove information that links your data to you individually. We are interested in discovering whether abnormal vocalization patterns in infants can predict neurodevelopmental delays such as autism. In order to do so, we need to analyze many thousands of audio samples from many thousands of babies, using a computer script to run some math(emagic) on it and throw the answers in a big spreadsheet to do even more math!

### 8)    Is there a warranty?
Nope. Nein. Zero. Zilch. Nada. 



### 9)    Is this a medical device?
No.  See also “Can I trust the ChatterBaby algorithm?“ above.



### 10) What about remote monitoring?
TBD.



### 11) Who do I contact for more information?
ChatterBaby was born in 2013 to Dr. Ariana Anderson, a UCLA Professor with advanced degrees in mathematics and behavioral sciences, and a mother of four. This project was started as a baby monitor for Deaf parents, and was created to translate a baby’s cry.  She can be reached at <arianaanderson@mednet.ucla.edu>.  This project would not have been possible without the support of UCLA, the Burroughs Wellcome Fund, and our numerous collaborators.
